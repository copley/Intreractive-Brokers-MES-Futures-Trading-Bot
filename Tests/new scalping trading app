Description of Components:
main.py:

The main script to run the backtest program. It initializes the configuration, data, and key managers, and controls the flow of the program.
config.yaml:

Stores all configuration parameters like trade times, indicator ranges, and trading rules. This allows for easy adjustments without changing the code.
indicators/:

atr_logic.py: Contains functions to calculate ATR, which helps determine stop-loss levels.
rsi_logic.py: Provides logic to compute RSI and derive buy/sell thresholds.
ema_logic.py: Handles calculation of short and long EMAs.
managers/:

trade_manager.py: Centralized manager for executing trades, making decisions based on entry/exit conditions, and managing positions.
entry_manager.py: Responsible for identifying when to open LONG/SHORT positions based on indicator signals and thresholds.
exit_manager.py: Works with stop_loss_manager.py and take_profit_manager.py to close positions based on achieved stop-loss or take-profit levels.
stop_loss_manager.py: Implements logic to adjust stop-loss positions dynamically, including adaptive stop-loss features via dynamic_stop_loss.py.
take_profit_manager.py: Sets and adjusts take-profit targets, ensuring profits are captured without holding positions for too long.
dynamic_stop_loss.py: Specialized module for monitoring and dynamically adjusting stop-losses when market conditions change.
execution/:

trade_execution_logic.py: Overall management of trade execution, deciding when and how to send orders.
long_order_execution_logic.py: Specific logic for placing and managing LONG orders.
short_order_execution_logic.py: Specific logic for placing and managing SHORT orders.
stop_loss_order_execution_logic.py: Manages stop-loss orders and adjusts them as needed.
limit_order_execution_logic.py: Handles limit orders as part of the bracket order structure.
data/:

data_loader.py: Responsible for loading and preparing historical or live data for analysis and backtesting.
data_preprocessor.py: Processes raw data to ensure it is clean and ready for indicator calculation.
utils/:

program_log_logic.py: Centralized logging to track actions, trades, and errors, enabling easy debugging and monitoring.
helpers.py: Utility functions that support various components across the program.
Example Configuration File (config.yaml)
yaml
Copy code
trade_start_time: "09:30"
trade_end_time: "16:30"
point_value: 0.5
commission: 2.5
reverse_trades: false

# Indicator Ranges
atr_range: [0.1, 0.5, 10]
tp_range: [1.0, 3.0, 10]
rsi_buy_range: [10, 40, 5]
rsi_sell_range: [60, 90, 5]
ema_short_range: [5, 25, 5]
ema_long_range: [20, 80, 10]
Benefits of This Structure:
Modularity: Each component (indicators, managers, execution logic) is isolated, making it easy to understand, test, and modify.
Ease of Maintenance: Changes to logic (e.g., altering stop-loss adjustments or modifying EMA calculations) can be made in specific files without affecting the entire codebase.
Scalability: New features (like adding more indicators or advanced order types) can be integrated by adding new modules or extending existing ones.
Configuration Flexibility: Changes to thresholds, times, and ranges can be made via config.yaml, providing flexibility without altering code.
Next Steps:
Develop Each Module: Begin by developing key classes, starting with entry_manager.py and stop_loss_manager.py, to ensure core trading logic is functional.
Implement Logging: Use program_log_logic.py to keep track of actions, errors, and trade outcomes to facilitate troubleshooting.
Integrate the Execution Flow: Combine all components in main.py to create a seamless workflow for backtesting and live trading.
Testing: Ensure unit tests are written for each module to verify logic and catch issues early.
This structure provides a clear foundation for building your new scalping trading app, with a focus on reliability, flexibility, and ease of expansion. Let me know if you have any questions or need further customization!
