Below is a concise scalp-friendly logic that combines a few high-impact indicators in a simple, fast-reacting manner suitable for a 1-minute chart on MES. It’s designed to capture quick 3-point moves and cut losses quickly.

1. Core Idea: Momentum + Volume Confirmation
Momentum Filter (EMA Crossover + Price vs. VWAP)

EMA(9) & EMA(21): Fast signals for short-term trend direction.
VWAP: Acts as an intraday “fair value” line; price above VWAP is bullish, below is bearish.
Volume Filter (RVOL or Cumulative Delta)

Relative Volume (RVOL): Tells you if the current volume is higher than usual (e.g., RVOL > 1.5 = strong participation).
(Optional) Cumulative Delta (CDV): Confirms net buy vs. net sell volume.
Risk/Reward Management (ATR-based Stop)

ATR: Adjusts your stop-loss dynamically based on recent volatility.
Because you are aiming for a small, fixed profit target of ~3 points, your stop should also be tight, but large enough to avoid stop-outs on normal 1-minute “noise.”
2. Step-by-Step Logic
Establish Trend & Momentum

Calculate EMA(9) and EMA(21).
Bullish bias if EMA9 > EMA21
Bearish bias if EMA9 < EMA21
Check VWAP.
For long setups, you ideally want price above VWAP (additional confirmation of bullish bias).
For short setups, price should be below VWAP.
Confirm Volume Conditions

Compute Relative Volume (RVOL):
RVOL
=
Current Candle Volume
Average Volume over past 
𝑁
 candles
RVOL= 
Average Volume over past N candles
Current Candle Volume
​
 
Trade only when RVOL > 1.5 (or a threshold that indicates elevated participation).
This filters out quiet periods where scalps often fail due to lack of liquidity.
Entry Trigger

Long Entry (example):
EMA9 crosses above EMA21 (momentum shift to bullish).
Price is above VWAP (confirm bullish environment).
RVOL > 1.5 (strong participation).
(Optional) Check a short-term pullback to EMA9 or VWAP for an improved entry price.
Short Entry (inverse conditions):
EMA9 crosses below EMA21 (momentum shift to bearish).
Price is below VWAP (bearish environment).
RVOL > 1.5.
(Optional) Short a pop into EMA9/21 or a retest of VWAP from below.
Stop-Loss Placement

Calculate ATR (14) on the 1-minute chart (or choose a shorter ATR period if you want it to be very responsive).
For a small, tight stop:
Stop-Loss
=
Entry Price
−
(
1.0
 to 
1.5
)
×
ATR
Stop-Loss=Entry Price−(1.0 to 1.5)×ATR
Or place your stop just below/above the most recent swing point if that is within your ATR tolerance.
Take Profit

Since you want 3 points on the MES:
Take Profit
=
Entry Price
+
3
 points (for a long trade)
Take Profit=Entry Price+3 points (for a long trade)
Adjust if you see more momentum, but be consistent in your scalp approach.
Optional Add-On: Williams %R for Overbought/Oversold

You can incorporate Williams %R if you like to fade extremes or confirm pullback entries:
Buy if Williams %R < -90 (oversold) and other bullish conditions are present.
Sell if Williams %R > -10 (overbought) and other bearish conditions are present.
More useful if you are taking mean-reversion scalps at short-term extremes.
