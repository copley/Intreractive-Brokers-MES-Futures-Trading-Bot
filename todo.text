To add a backtesting feature that allows you to run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 main.py --test data.csv
The following modifications and additions will be needed in the file structure:

1. Modify main.py
Update main.py to parse command-line arguments and handle --test data.csv
If --test is provided, load and process historical data instead of running live trading.
2. Create a New File for Backtesting: backtest.py
This script will handle reading data.csv, computing indicators, and simulating trades using the same logic as live trading.
It will use the TradeManager to process each bar of historical data.
3. Update utils/helpers.py
Add a helper function to load historical data from a CSV file.
4. File Structure Changes

Key Code Changes
1. Modify main.py to Support Backtesting
Modify main.py to detect the --test argument and switch execution to backtest.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import argparse
import logging
from utils import helpers
from utils.aggregator import Aggregator
from backtest import Backtester  # New backtesting module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--test", type=str, help="Run backtest with historical data CSV file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.test:
        # Run backtest mode
        logging.info(f"Running backtest with {args.test}")
        backtester = Backtester(args.test)
        backtester.run_backtest()
    else:
        # Load configuration and run live trading
        config = helpers.load_config("config.yaml")
        if not config:
            raise SystemExit("Failed to load configuration. Exiting.")

        helpers.setup_logging(level=config.get('logging', {}).get('level', 'INFO'),
                              log_file=config.get('logging', {}).get('file'))

        logging.info("Starting trading bot...")
        bot = Aggregator(config)
        bot.run()
        logging.info("Trading bot finished execution.")
2. Create backtest.py
This script reads historical data, processes indicators, and simulates trades.

        if df is None:
            return

        df = self.compute_indicators(df)

        for _, row in df.iterrows():
            bar_data = {
                "time": row["time"],
                "open": row["price"],
                "high": row["high"],
                "low": row["low"],
                "close": row["price"],
                "volume": row.get("volume", 0),
            }

            }

            self.trade_manager.update(bar_data, indicators)

        logging.info("Backtest completed.")
3. Update utils/helpers.py
Add a function to load historical data:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import logging

def load_historical_data(file_path):
    """
    Load historical data from a CSV file and return a DataFrame.
    """
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])
        df.sort_values(by='time', inplace=True)
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error loading historical data: {e}")
        return None
How It Works
If python3 main.py --test data.csv is run:

main.py detects --test and calls Backtester.
Backtester loads data.csv, computes indicators, and simulates trades.
Trades are processed through the TradeManager.
If python3 main.py is run without --test:

The bot runs in live mode using Aggregator.
Summary of Changes
✅ Updated main.py → Handles --test data.csv
✅ New backtest.py → Simulates trades with historical data
✅ Updated utils/helpers.py → Loads historical data
✅ No changes needed for TradeManager → Works for both live and backtest mode

Below is an overview of what the trade logs look like and how to ensure they only open one trade at a time, plus an example of how to include stop-loss, entry, exit, and timestamps in your log lines.

1. What the Logs Look Like in the Terminal
When a trade is triggered, you39ll typically see something like:

plaintext
Copy
2025-02-20 00:30:15,612 [INFO] TradeExecutor: Initiating LONG position for quantity 1
2025-02-20 00:30:15,613 [INFO] Placing order 1: <Order MKT BUY 1@None>
2025-02-20 00:30:15,614 [INFO] ENTRY LONG @ 6141.25
Then, when the exit occurs:

plaintext
Copy
2025-02-20 00:45:00,982 [INFO] TradeExecutor: Exiting position -> SELL 1 (market order)
2025-02-20 00:45:00,983 [INFO] EXIT LONG @ 6142.50, P/L: 1.25, Reason: take_profit_hit
These messages come from various places in the code:

TradeExecutor logs 34Initiating LONG/SHORT34 or 34Exiting position -> SELL/BUY.34
place_order in ib_connection.py logs the actual order object being placed.
TradeManager logs 34ENTRY34 and 34EXIT34 lines to trade_record.text (and also logs an [INFO] message about the exit reason).
2. Ensuring Only One Trade at a Time
Your TradeManager is already coded to hold only one open position at a time:

python
Copy
if self.current_position is None:
    # No open position, check for entry signal
    ...
    else:
        # There is an open position, manage it
    As soon as self.current_position is set, the bot will not open another trade until it39s cleared (i.e., after an exit).
    So you already have the 34one trade at a time34 logic in place.
    3. Recording Stop-Loss, Entry, Exit, Time, etc.
    Right now, trade_record.text logs lines like:

    python
    Copy
    with open("trade_record.text", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"ENTRY {pos_type} @ {entry_price:.4f}\n")
        and later:

        python
        Copy
        with open("trade_record.text", "a") as f:
            f.write(f"EXIT {pos_type} @ {exit_price:.4f}, P/L: {profit:.2f}, Reason: {exit_reason}\n")
            If you also want the stop-loss level, time/date, or other fields, just expand these lines. For example:

            3.1 Modify the 34ENTRY34 line to include stop-loss and timestamp
            In TradeManager.update() where it logs the entry:

            python
            Copy
            with open("trade_record.text", "a") as f:
                f.write(
                                f"ENTRY {pos_type} @ {entry_price:.4f}, "
                                        f"SL={stop_loss_price:.4f}, "
                                                f"Time={data_point.get('time')}\n"
                                                    )
                You could also format the time differently (e.g., time.strftime(...)) if you want.

                3.2 Modify the 34EXIT34 line similarly
                python
                Copy
                with open("trade_record.text", "a") as f:
                    f.write(
                                    f"EXIT {pos_type} @ {exit_price:.4f}, "
                                            f"SL was={stop_price:.4f}, "
                                                    f"P/L: {profit:.2f}, "
                                                            f"Time={data_point.get('time')}, "
                                                                    f"Reason: {exit_reason}\n"
                                                                        )
                    (This assumes you still have access to stop_price or store it in self.current_position so you can log it.)

    4. Sample 34trade_record.text34 Output
    After adding those tweaks, your trade_record.text might look like:

    yaml
    Copy
    ENTRY LONG @ 6141.25, SL=6139.00, Time=2025-02-20 00:30:15
    EXIT LONG @ 6142.50, SL was=6139.00, P/L: 1.25, Time=2025-02-20 00:45:00, Reason: take_profit_hit
    ENTRY SHORT @ 6142.00, SL=6143.50, Time=2025-02-20 01:10:05
    EXIT SHORT @ 6141.50, SL was=6143.50, P/L: 0.50, Time=2025-02-20 01:11:12, Reason: take_profit_hit
    ...
    That way you can see each trade39s entry, exit, stop-loss, timestamp, and outcome.

    In Summary
    Terminal logs show IB connection messages, order placements, and info lines from TradeExecutor and TradeManager.
    trade_record.text is where each ENTRY and EXIT is appended, including prices, stop-loss, timestamps, etc.
    The code already supports only one open trade at a time.
    If you want more detail (like stop-loss in your logs), just expand the f.write(...) lines in TradeManager to include those fields.





    You said:
    ok, and what size are my current orders that it places? like does it use ATR? for stop loss and limit order take profit? for example in the sample, I want a take profit level for the entry as well. 
    ensures only **one trade at a time** by checking if there's an active position (`self.current_position`) before placing a new trade. You can easily enhance the `trade_record.text` logging to include additional details such as **stop-loss**, **entry/exit prices**, and **timestamps** for each trade. Here39s how you can expect the log to unfold: - **In the terminal**: When a trade is executed, you39d see **[INFO]** log entries about **trade initiation** and **completion** like: ```plaintext 2025-02-20 00:30:15,612 [INFO] TradeExecutor: Initiating LONG position for quantity 1 2025-02-20 00:30:15,613 [INFO] Placing order 1: <Order MKT BUY 1@None> 2025-02-20 00:30:15,614 [INFO] ENTRY LONG @ 6141.25 ``` Once the exit occurs: ```plaintext 2025-02-20 00:45:00,982 [INFO] TradeExecutor: Exiting position -> SELL 1 (market order) 2025-02-20 00:45:00,983 [INFO] EXIT LONG @ 6142.50, P/L: 1.25, Reason: take_profit_hit ``` - **With one open trade at a time**, the system doesn't allow overlapping trades unless the prior one completes (either via exit or stop-loss). By tweaking the logging lines, we ensure **entry, exit**, **stop-loss details**, and actual timestamps are well-documented. An updated log entry could look like: ```plaintext ENTRY LONG @ 6141.25, SL=6139.00, Time=2025-02-20 00:30:15 EXIT LONG @ 6142.50, SL was=6139.00, P/L: 1.25, Time=2025-02-20 00:45:00, Reason: take_profit_hit ``` Would you like further assistance with the specific changes to the code or setting up the trade tracking for one trade at a time? for 26 seconds
    Currently, your trade size is always 1 contract (or 1 share, 1 lot, etc.)45the code has a hard-coded quantity = 1. There is no dynamic sizing based on ATR or anything else. If you open trade_manager.py and look at the section:

    python
    Copy
    if self.current_position is None:
        # ...
        quantity = 1  # <--- always trades 1 contract
            entry_price = price
                pos_type = entry_signal['type']
                    # ...
                So every time the bot opens a new position, it uses quantity = 1.

                1. Are We Using ATR for Stop-Loss/Take-Profit?
                Aggregator/TradeManager approach (the main 34live34 code)
    In trade_manager.py, the stop-loss and take-profit are derived from percentages in your config.yaml, specifically:
    python
    Copy
    sl_pct = self.config['trading']['stop_loss_pct']
    tp_pct = self.config['trading']['take_profit_pct']
    For a LONG trade:
    python
    Copy
    stop_loss_price = entry_price * (1 - sl_pct)
    take_profit_price = entry_price * (1 + tp_pct)
    For a SHORT trade:
    python
    Copy
    stop_loss_price = entry_price * (1 + sl_pct)
    take_profit_price = entry_price * (1 - tp_pct)
    So if stop_loss_pct = 0.005 (0.5%) and take_profit_pct = 0.01 (1%), the code sets your SL and TP relative to entry_price by those percentages.
    In other words, the default aggregator logic does not use ATR for stop-loss or take-profit. It uses a simple percentage-based approach.

    EmaRsiAtrStrategy (the sample backtest code)
    That code snippet does something like:
    python
    Copy
    stop_loss = tick['price'] - (atr_val * 1.5)
    take_profit = tick['price'] + (atr_val * 3)
    So in that example, it uses ATR multiples for SL and TP.
    But that39s only in the 34Tests/MES_EMA_RSI_ATR_Trading_Strategy.py34 file, which is a separate, more advanced backtest example.
    2. Adding a Take-Profit Level (Limit Order)
    The TradeManager already sets a take_profit price when it sees tp_pct in the config. Then the TradeExecutor places a limit order for that take-profit. For a LONG trade:

    python
    Copy
    if signal.get('take_profit'):
            execute_limit_order(self.ib, self.contract, "SELL", quantity, signal['take_profit'])
            So, yes, you do get a take-profit limit order automatically if take_profit is set in the trade signal. And that trade signal is built by TradeManager using the config percentage.

            3. Only One Trade at a Time
            Your code is already limited to a single open position:

            If self.current_position is None, it checks for a new entry signal.
            Once a position is open (self.current_position is not None), the code just manages that single position (stop-loss, take-profit, exit signals). It will not open another trade until the current position is exited.
            Hence you get exactly 34one trade at a time3445the next trade only happens after the previous position is closed.

            4. Summary
            Position Size: Always 1 contract by default (hard-coded in trade_manager.py).
            Stop-Loss / Take-Profit:
            Live aggregator code uses percentage of entry price from your YAML config (stop_loss_pct, take_profit_pct).
            The ATR approach is shown in the sample backtest code, not in the live aggregator.
            Take-Profit: The code does place a limit order for your take_profit automatically.
            One Trade at a Time: Already enforced by the self.current_position check45no second trade is opened until the first one is fully exited.


Reasoned for 9 seconds
Yes – you can have IB deliver 15‐second bars by simply changing the barSize parameter when calling reqRealTimeBars. The raw data will be accurate, but keep in mind that your indicators (EMA, RSI, ATR, etc.) are based on bar resolution. If your strategy was tuned on 5‑second bars, you might need to adjust indicator periods or other parameters when using 15‑second bars.

Below is an updated snippet from your live MES downloader (from account_and_positions.py / live_mes_data_downloader.py) where the bar size is changed from 5 seconds to 15 seconds:

python
Copy
def request_realtime_bars(self):
    """
    Send the reqRealTimeBars for MES contract using the config.
    Modified to use 15-second bars.
    """
    c_dict = self.config["contract"]
    mes_contract = Contract()
    mes_contract.symbol = c_dict["symbol"]
    mes_contract.secType = c_dict["sec_type"]
    mes_contract.exchange = c_dict["exchange"]
    mes_contract.currency = c_dict["currency"]
    mes_contract.lastTradeDateOrContractMonth = c_dict["lastTradeDateOrContractMonth"]
    mes_contract.localSymbol = c_dict["localSymbol"]
    mes_contract.multiplier = c_dict["multiplier"]

    logging.info("Requesting 15-second bars for MES (re)subscription...")
    self.reqRealTimeBars(
        reqId=self.req_id_for_bars,
        contract=mes_contract,
        barSize=15,           # Changed to 15-second bars
        whatToShow="TRADES",
        useRTH=False,
        realTimeBarsOptions=[]
    )
In your aggregator (or wherever you subscribe to real‑time bars), change the barSize parameter similarly. The aggregated bar data will be accurate over 15‑second intervals, but you should verify that your indicator calculations and strategy logic still make sense with the new timeframe.
